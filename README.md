# Facial Recognition Application

This Repository is an implementation of [Siamese Neural Networks for One-shot Image Recognition](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rsalakhu/papers/oneshot1.pdf) by G. Koch et al.

Facial Recognition using Siamese Neural Networks for One-shot Image Recognition. A unique structure is employed to naturally rank similarity between inputs. A convolutional architecture is used to achieve strong results which exceed those of other deep learning models with near state-of-the-art performance on one-shot classification tasks.

# Dataset 
The data used for training contains two parts, the positive and the anchor images are collected through webcam while the negative images are taken from [Labelled Faces in the Wild](http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/) Dataset.
